This project was completed in a 5 week time frame.  Please, forgive the somewhat
convoluted nature of our software. finalmainwithstatemachine.c and finalnostatemachine.c both 
contain working versions of our code, but do slightly different things.  With state machine, 
cycles through 3 differnt colored images, and no state machine project one multicolered image.
Thank you for checking out Spoke Ink!

All the best,
George, Val, and Ryan
